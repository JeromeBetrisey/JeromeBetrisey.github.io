My name is Jerôme Bétrisey and I come from the canton of Valais, in Switzerland. I did my studies at the ETH Zürich in Switzerland, where I wrote my master thesis under the supervision of Prof. Hans Martin Schmid. During that time, I studied the opacity properties of circumstellar disks based on photometric and polarimetric measurements.

My name is Jérôme Bétrisey and I come from the canton of Valais, in Switzerland. I did my studies at the ETH Zürich in Switzerland, where I wrote my master thesis under the supervision of Prof. Hans Martin Schmid. During that time, I studied the opacity properties of circumstellar disks based on photometric and polarimetric measurements. The goal of my master thesis was to better understand the correlation between the star energy reemitted by the outer disk(s) in the spectral energy distribution and the polarized disk/star contrast. This project sparked my interest in stellar characterisation that was the main limiting factor of this study. I am currently a last year PhD student in the stellar group of Prof. Georges Meynet at the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland, under the supervision of Prof. Georges Meynet and Dr. Gaël Buldgen. I am specialising in seismic inferences of the internal stellar structure and I am presently mainly focusing on their applications to main-sequence solar-type stars.

My goal is to improve stellar characterisation in order to achieve a more precise and accurate stellar mass, radius and age, crucial for the preparation of the PLATO mission. I can then use these improved stellar parameters to do multidisciplinary applications in exoplanetology, where I can revise the planetary parameters, or in galactic archaeology. This goal is achieved by following two guidelines, improving the modelling strategies and improving the physics in stellar models. During the first years of my PhD, I followed these guidelines, therefore improving the current modelling strategies and developing new approaches to constrain the physics in stellar models. Hence, I refined my modelling strategy, that combines seismic inversions, and global and local minimisations, to achieve stellar parameters with an unprecedented robustness and accuracy. In particular, I demonstrated that my modelling strategy efficiently damps the so-called surface effects which are a recurrent issue in asteroseismology.

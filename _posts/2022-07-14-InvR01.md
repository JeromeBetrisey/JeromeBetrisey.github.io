## Context

With the rapid development of asteroseismology thanks to space-based photometry missions such as CoRoT, *Kepler*, TESS, and in the future, PLATO, and the use of inversion techniques, quasi-model-independent constraints on the stellar properties can be extracted from a given stellar oscillation spectrum. In this context, inversions based on frequency separation ratios, which are less sensitive to surface effects, appear as a promising technique to constrain the properties of stellar convective cores. We therefore developed an inversion based on frequency separation ratios, with the goal of damping the surface effects of the oscillation frequencies. Using this new inversion, we defined a new indicator to constrain the boundary mixing properties of convective cores in solar-like oscillators.

This study lead to a publication in *Astronomy and Astrophysics* ([BÃ©trisey & Buldgen 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...663A..92B/abstract)) and was presented at several international conferences ([poster](https://zenodo.org/record/5075976#.ZHcbIuxBz6A) on preliminary results at the *TESS Science Conference 2* and contributed talk at the *TASC6/KASC13 Workshop*).

## Context

Thanks to the so-called photometry revolution with the space-based missions CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS, asteroseismology has become a powerful tool to study the internal rotation of stars. The rotation rate depends on the efficiency of the angular momentum transport inside the star, and its study allows to constrain the internal AM transport processes, as well as improve our understanding of their physical nature. In this context, we compared the ratio of the rotation rate predicted by asteroseismology and starspot measurements of solar-type stars considering different angular momentum transport prescriptions and investigated whether some of these prescriptions can be ruled out observationally.

This study lead to a publication in *Astronomy & Astrophysics* ([BÃ©trisey et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...673L..11B/abstract)) and was presented in several international conferences (poster at the *PLATO Stellar Science Conference 2023* and poster at the *TASC7/KASC14 Workshop*)

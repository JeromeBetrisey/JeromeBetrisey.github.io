## Context

The advent of space-based photometry missions such as CoRoT, *Kepler* and TESS has sparkled the rapid development of asteroseismology and its synergies with exoplanetology. In the near future, the advent of PLATO will further strengthen such multi-disciplinary studies. In that respect, testing asteroseismic modelling strategies and their importance for our understanding of planetary systems is crucial. In this context, we carried out a detailed modelling of Kepler-93, an exoplanet host star observed by the Kepler satellite for which high-quality seismic data are available. This star is particularly interesting because it is a solar-like star very similar to the PLATO benchmark target (G spectral type, \\( \sim 6000 \\) K, \\( \sim 1 M_\odot \\) and \\( \sim 1 R_\odot \\)) and provides a real-life testbed for potential procedures to be used in the PLATO mission.

This study lead to a publication in *Astronomy and Astrophysics* ([BÃ©trisey et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...659A..56B/abstract)) and was presented in several international conferences (pre-recorded contributed talk at the *PLATO Mission Conference 2021* and [poster](https://zenodo.org/record/7347403#.ZHcTWOxBz6A) at the *21st Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars, Stellar Systems, and the Sun*).

## Highlights

We provide the following fundamental parameters for Kepler-93: 

| Stellar mean density | \\( \bar{\rho}_\star = 1.654 \pm 0.004 \\) g/cm\\(^3\\) |
| Stellar radius       | ...                                                     |

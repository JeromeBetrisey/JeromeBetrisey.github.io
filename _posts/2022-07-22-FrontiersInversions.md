My name is Jérôme Bétrisey and I come from the canton of Valais, in Switzerland. I did my studies at the ETH Zürich in Switzerland, where I wrote my master thesis under the supervision of Prof. Hans Martin Schmid.
During that time, I studied the opacity properties of circumstellar disks based on photometric and polarimetric
measurements. The goal of my master thesis was to better understand the correlation between the star energy reemitted by the outer disk(s) in the spectral energy distribution and the polarized disk/star contrast.
